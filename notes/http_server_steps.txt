1. When client connects send back HTTP 1.0 "200 OK" response and a dummy minimal HTML-encoded message before closing connection

2. Parse the request from the client, ignore headers

3. If the GET request is validly formatted, send 200, else send 400 and dummy message
Respond with 501 to any other request that isn't GET

4. Make a folder the root "/" directory, put index.html into it and another HTML file, add img file too
When server starts, verify the root folder existing and that we have permissions to view the contents

5. Parse path from valid GET request, after parsing check if path is "/", server index.html
If the requested file doesn't exist, respond with 404
Make this work for text and binary files (images)

6. Add new folders to root, add dummy html files + dummy index.html files
Add a few levels of nested folders
Modify program to improve path-parsing logic to handle folders and handle responses appropriately

7. Modify read permissions on a few dummy folders and files, if read permission forbidden respond with 403
